      question: "Why does VIBBA increase focus?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            VIBBA uses scientifically designed audio frequencies that synchronize with your brainwaves to enhance neural
            coherence and optimize cognitive function.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a way, you could think of VIBBA as neural entrainment 2.0. We took the concept behind traditional audio
            therapies and applied an updated understanding of neuroscience and auditory processing to create a more
            effective and powerful solution.
          </p>
          <p>Some core mechanisms:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>VIBBA impacts the prefrontal cortex which is where all your thinking and creativity comes from</li>
            <li>Our frequencies help reduce distracting thoughts by stabilizing neural oscillations</li>
            <li>The audio patterns create an optimal environment for sustained attention</li>
            <li>Background noise and distractions are effectively masked by our carefully designed soundscapes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Most importantly, VIBBA uses many methods to make our audio work, not just a single technique!</p>

      question: "Is this the same as binaural beats?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            VIBBA is not binaural beats. There are some similarities, but it's important to remember that binaural beats
            were first discovered in 1839, popularized in the 1970's and haven't really changed since.

            powerful solution.
          </p>
          <p>Some core differences:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Binaural beats primarily impacts the lower brain which is not where thinking or creativity occurs.</li>
            <li>VIBBA impacts the prefrontal cortex which is where all your thinking and creativity comes from</li>
            <li>
              Binaural beats requires both ears to be free of hearing damage and high quality headphones to be on.
            </li>
            <li>
              VIBBA works with one or two ears, does not require headphones, and is not dependent on your ability to
              hear certain frequencies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most importantly, VIBBA uses many methods to make our audio work, unlike binaural beats which is just one
            technique!

      answer: (

          <p>
            Our research is based on multiple studies with varying sample sizes, designed to validate different aspects
            of our technology.
          </p>
          <p>Our primary efficacy studies included:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>A controlled laboratory study with 34 participants measuring cognitive performance</li>
            <li>A field study with over 150 regular users tracking productivity metrics over time</li>
            <li>EEG measurements from 28 subjects showing neural entrainment effects</li>
            <li>A comparative analysis against traditional focus-enhancing audio with 45 participants</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We continue to expand our research program and collaborate with neuroscience researchers to further validate
            and improve our technology.

      question: "Is this only for people with ADHD?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            No, VIBBA is designed for everyone who wants to improve their focus, relaxation, or sleep quality,
            regardless of whether they have ADHD or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            While many users with ADHD report significant benefits from our sessions, our technology works with the
            fundamental neural mechanisms that all humans share.
          </p>
          <p>VIBBA helps with:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>General focus and productivity for anyone doing knowledge work</li>
            <li>Creative flow states for artists, writers, and other creative professionals</li>
            <li>Relaxation and stress reduction for anyone experiencing tension</li>
            <li>Sleep quality improvement for those with occasional sleep difficulties</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Our diverse user base includes students, professionals, creatives, and anyone looking to optimize their
            mental state for specific activities.

      question: "Why is this better for focus than normal music?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>
            Unlike regular music, VIBBA is specifically engineered to enhance cognitive function rather than just
            provide entertainment.
          </p>
          <p>Key differences include:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Regular music often contains lyrics, which compete for your verbal processing resources</li>
            <li>Music typically has dynamic changes in tempo, volume, and emotional tone that can be distracting</li>
            <li>VIBBA uses precise frequencies and patterns that work with your brain's natural rhythms</li>
            <li>Our audio maintains consistent properties that create an optimal environment for sustained focus</li>
            <li>
              Regular music is designed to engage your emotions; VIBBA is designed to optimize your cognitive state
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While some instrumental music can be helpful for focus, it's not specifically designed for cognitive
            enhancement the way VIBBA is.

      question: "How do I make VIBBA work best for me?",
      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-300">
          <p>To get the most out of VIBBA, we recommend following these best practices:</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Use headphones when possible for the most immersive experience</li>
            <li>Start with 15-30 minute sessions and gradually increase as needed</li>
            <li>Match the session type to your activity (focus for work, relax for unwinding, etc.)</li>
            <li>Set a clear intention for what you want to accomplish during your session</li>
            <li>Use VIBBA consistently to train your brain to respond more quickly to the frequencies</li>
            <li>Experiment with different volume levels to find what works best for you</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everyone's brain is unique, so don't be afraid to experiment with different session types and settings to
            find your optimal configuration.
