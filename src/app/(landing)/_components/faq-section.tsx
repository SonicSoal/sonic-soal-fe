      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            SonicSoal is a frequency-optimized audio platform designed to enhance focus, clarity, and
            spiritual alignment through personalized sound experiences powered by your birth data, daily
            mood, and intention.

      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            No. While SonicSoal may use elements of frequency entrainment, it’s not just binaural beats.
            Our audio is dynamic, intention-based, and personalized using tools like AstroSync™ and Inner
            Archive™ readings.

      answer: (
        <div className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
          <p>
            By aligning frequencies with your personal energetic profile, SonicSoal tunes your mental and
            emotional state for clarity, flow, and reduced cognitive clutter. Users often report entering “flow”
            states within minutes.

          <p>
            <b>$SOAL</b>  is the utility token used within the SonicSoal ecosystem. It’s used to unlock premium
            rituals, personalized content, and eventually contribute to your SoulPrint™ progression and
            Inner Archive™ access.

            Not at all. While it can support neurodivergent focus needs, SonicSoal is built for anyone
            seeking better mental clarity, emotional balance, or spiritual insight through sound.

          <p>SonicSoal goes beyond generic soundtracks. It personalizes audio in real time based on your
            birth chart, mood, and intentions. It’s part sound healing, part ritual technology.</p>

          <p>Use caution. Some frequencies are deeply immersive or meditative and may reduce alertness.
            We recommend using “Focus Mode” only while stationary or during light tasks, not while driving
            or operating machinery.</p>

            SonicSoal’s sound alignment. We recommend drinking water before and after longer sessions.</p>
